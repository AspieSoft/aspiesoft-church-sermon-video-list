An easy way for a church to list there sermon videos on their website.

== Description ==

An easy way for a church to list there sermon videos on their website.
It includes an advanced search, which will search based on date, name, or scripture.
For example, If you have a video with the scripture set to "Psalm 16:1-11", the search will allow "Psalm 16:8" to match that, because 8 is between 1 and 11.
The search also includes some spelling corrections, to help people who spell things phonetically.

I originally made this plugin for a pastor I know, and decided to make it public so other churches could use it.
